1- Make sure the bam file is coordinate sorted, if not 
	samtools sort test.bam -o tmp
	mv tmp test.bam

2- Use the code in genome folder to create the test.p.bam (see README in that folder)
	if the bam was generated by aligning the reads to transcriptome, use the code in transcriptome folder

3- Use the code in diff folder to create test.diff (see README in that folder)

4- If you want to generate the bam from p.bam and diff, use the code in the pbam2bam folder (see README in that folder)
